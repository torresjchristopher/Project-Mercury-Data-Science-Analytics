## Domain Quirks & Characteristics

### Unique Challenges
1. **Real-Time vs Batch Tradeoffs** - Must balance latency, throughput, and consistency
2. **Data Drift Detection** - Models decay over time; need automated monitoring
3. **Feature Leakage Prevention** - Easy to accidentally use future data in training
4. **Distributed System Complexity** - Multi-machine coordination at scale
5. **Privacy at Scale** - How to train on sensitive data safely

### Technology Synergies
- Task 1 (Kafka) feeds into Task 5 (Analytics) for real-time insights
- Task 6 (Feature Store) is consumed by Task 2 (ML Observability)
- Task 7 (Privacy) enhances all other tasks' security posture
- Task 8 (Spark) processes raw data for Task 6 materialization
- Together = end-to-end ML infrastructure companies actually build

### Real-World Applications
✅ **Streaming Analytics:** Real-time dashboards, fraud detection (Task 1)  
✅ **ML Ops:** Production model monitoring, retraining triggers (Task 2)  
✅ **Forecasting:** Stock prices, weather, demand planning (Task 3)  
✅ **Data Governance:** Quality assurance, compliance reporting (Task 4)  
✅ **Business Intelligence:** Custom analytics engines (Task 5)  
✅ **ML Infrastructure:** Feature serving for models (Task 6)  
✅ **Privacy Compliance:** HIPAA, GDPR compliant AI (Task 7)  
✅ **Big Data Processing:** Terabyte-scale transformations (Task 8)

### Skills Demonstrated
- Stream processing architecture (Kafka, Flink)
- Data warehouse design (Delta Lake, Iceberg)
- ML lifecycle management (MLflow, Wandb)
- Time series analysis (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM)
- Distributed computing (Spark, Dask)
- Privacy engineering (differential privacy, federated learning)
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Performance optimization (vectorization, caching)
